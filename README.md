# URL-shortener

[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.svg)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

Url Shortner is an Express Application for Generating short URLs on your domain. Often we want to share links to a website to other platforms, But the links are too long.

If I talk about this blog.
The link will be something like...

```bash
https://dev.to/pranjaljain0/creating-a-very-simple-url-shortner-using-express...
```

Which is already occupying _77 characters_ when it can occupy around _10 characters_.
